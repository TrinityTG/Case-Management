# Case-Management
## Introduction
The Case Management pattern describes the roles, activities, and connections that are or should be found in business functions such as application processing, licensing, appeals management, and more.

## Importance of Applying Pattern Approach
The pattern tells us what activities to plan for in the end to end business process for a case management related solution.  Each needed activity serves as a prompt to guide the business analysts in working with the subject matter experts to elicit and define the specifications for the new system.  The pattern includes the interactions of the customers and the internal users with the new system as well as the activities that may be performed outside of automation.  Activities may be performed by other systems, by vendors, or other agencies.  
In looking for ways to enhance the performance the pattern analysts can compare the activities in the pattern to the AS IS process to identify gaps, misalignment, and other variances.
