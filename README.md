# Case-Management
## Introduction
The Case Management pattern describes the roles, activities, and connections that are or should be found in business functions such as application processing, licensing, appeals management, and more.

Scott Ambler has proposed a metadata standard for describing patterns of any type.  In the spirit of cooperation this section applies Ambler’s recommendations to introduce the Case Management pattern:

**Pattern Attribute	-  Description**

**Pattern Name**	-  Case Management Pattern

**Intent**	-  Describe the most frequently found, most common, processes, functions and features for solutions that involve case management.  The use of the term Pattern here applies to the business functionality, not the lower level workflow patterns or software engineering patterns.  Sadly, there is very little reference material on re-usable business functionality.  We see Requests for Proposals from organizations that provide detailed itemization of requirements -- but from one RFP to the next there is little recognition of the similarities in the overarching needs from one company to the next.  Software product vendors will provide some organization to their functionality but not in a way that readily enables comparing one product to another.  The Case Management Pattern has as one of its objectives to provide a framework to consistently evaluate products.  In this regard, the case management pattern is an effort to provide the **canonical model** of functionality for case management applications.

**Type**	-- End to end Business Process encompanying all phases, stages and tasks.

**Initial Context**	 --  The entry condition is a potential customer awareness of the product or service supported by the case management solution.

**Solution**	--  The Case Management Pattern guides the business analyst in the preparation of a straw model and elicitation of requirements from subject matter experts; guides the technical architect in defining the servers and products required to support the functionality.

**Resulting Context**	--   The business analyst will have a complete set of process models, use cases, functional requirements and other end to end guidance to evaluate product offerings, build versus buy analysis, bid specifications, or guidance for the detailed design and build using either an agile or other system development life cycle.

**Related Patterns**	This is a composite pattern that may incorporate task-level patterns to better define individual activities within the Case Management Pattern’s larger framework. Any task or stage-level pattern can be incorporated into the Case Management pattern and ensure that gaps, duplication, and conflicts can be addressed.

**Known Uses/Examples**	Most automated systems to support case management solutions have many of the functions and features described.  Any capabilities found in a solution not included in the Pattern are candidates for incorporation.


## Importance of Applying Pattern Approach
The pattern tells us what activities to plan for in the end to end business process for a case management related solution.  Each needed activity serves as a prompt to guide the business analysts in working with the subject matter experts to elicit and define the specifications for the new system.  The pattern includes the interactions of the customers and the internal users with the new system as well as the activities that may be performed outside of automation.  Activities may be performed by other systems, by vendors, or other agencies.  
In looking for ways to enhance the performance the pattern analysts can compare the activities in the pattern to the AS IS process to identify gaps, misalignment, and other variances.
